                    Hi everyone! My name is Max and as previously mentioned, I am an aspiring software engineer.
                    <br />
                    Throughout my life I have enjoyed computers, I always found it fascinating how the way that computers are able to do such complex things seems like magic.
                    <br />
                    However, as most of us in the field know and how my instructor always says, it is far from magic.
                    <br />
                    Actually, it is even more fascinating understanding how they work and why they work. I find great joy in creating something from scratch and watch it come to life in real time. Which is exactly why I do what I do.
                    <br />
                    I am currently attending a fullstack coding bootcamp at the University of Miami and currently work there as a desktop support technician.
